# 🧹 Delete All GitHub Actions Workflow Runs
#
# This workflow allows you to delete all GitHub Actions workflow runs
# for a given repository, optionally filtering by `status`.
#
# It supports deletion of:
# - All workflow runs (no filter)
# - Only completed / failed / cancelled / in_progress / queued runs
#
# Inputs:
#   - github_repository: Full repository name (e.g., owner/repo) [required]
#   - status: Optional status filter (completed, in_progress, queued)
#
# Environment:
#   - Requires WORKFLOW_TOKEN and GITHUB_TOKEN with repo scope
#
# Example usage:
#   - Delete all runs: Set only github_repository
#   - Delete only completed runs: Set status to "completed"
